# consignmentcalc
 
This is a program for keeping track of consignment inventory and sales. The program will allow you to create items, and attach prices and cost to that item. The program will then allow you to create locations for consignment. You will be able to "drop off" items at the consignment location, then tally up the remaining items on whatever basis suits your needs. The sales will automatically be subtracted from the original dropoff amount.
